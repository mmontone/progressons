# Progressons

Display a progress bar on one line.

    [1437/1437]>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>[100%]

- [X] Support for real and dumb terminal windows
  - on the terminal, it correctly updates the progress percent and the number of items. On a dumb terminal like Emacs Slime, it can't erase the previous step to update the numbers, so it simply prints one progress indicator after the other, still on one line.


## Usage

Instantiate with `(progressbar data)` and call `(step!)` at each iteration.

(`data` must comply to `length`)

~~~lisp
(loop for elt in (progressbar (list 1 2 3 4 5))
   do (do-something-with elt)
      (sleep 0.1)
      (step!))
~~~

Manual demo:

```
CL-USER> (progressbar (list 1 2 3 4 5))
(1 2 3 4 5)
#<PROGRESS BAR, length 5, step 16>

CL-USER> (step!)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>                                                                [20]

CL-USER>  (step!)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>                                                [40]
[â€¦]
CL-USER>  (step!)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>[100]
```

We'd like to remove the need of calling `(step!)` eventually.


## Do it yourself

The guist of a progress bar is to print a string, then erase it to
print a longer one by printing a backspace character `(write-char #\return)`.
