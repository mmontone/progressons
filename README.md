# Progressons

A simple progress bar on one line.


Support for real and dumb terminal windows:

On the terminal, it correctly shows progress. On a dumb terminal (Emacs' default shell), it doesn't try to erase the previous step because (it's messy), but it shows one progress line per step.


## Usage

Instantiate with `progressbar data` and call `(step!)` at each iteration.

~~~lisp
(loop for elt in (progressbar (list 1 2 3 4 5))
   do (do-something-with elt)
      (step!))
~~~


Manual demo:

```
CL-USER> (progressbar (list 1 2 3 4 5))
(1 2 3 4 5)
#<PROGRESS BAR, length 5, step 16>

CL-USER> (step!)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>                                                                [20]

CL-USER>  (step!)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>                                                [40]
[â€¦]
CL-USER>  (step!)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>[100]
```

How to get rid off the need of calling `step!` ?


## Do it yourself

The guist of a progress bar is to print a string, then erase it to
print a longer one by printing a backspace character `(write-char #\return)`.
